 MMU game a week, Week 1

DESERT BIRDS

Controls:
input axis vertical (W/S/up and down arrows) controlls the pitch or x rotation of the flock of birds
input axis horizontal (A/D/Left and Right arrows) controlls the Roll or z rotation of the flock of birds

Objective:
this games objective is to travel as far as possible across a desert without your flock dying, you can add birds to your flock by flying near to other birds.
(inspired by desert bus)

Reasources:
used this brackeys tutorial to help build my procedural terrain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFvwyu_ZKfU

My microphone is broken so the main features that i wanted to show off in the video are:
-i made my own boids algorithm that works quite well and dosent require much code, 
-i used post processing to turn my black and white game with no assets into a monochromatic orangescale game that fits the extra challenge,
-procedural terrain that follows the player so they can use it to help navigate ad use shadows to find nearby birds to add to their flock
